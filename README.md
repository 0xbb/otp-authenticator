#  andOTP -  Android OTP Authenticator
![andOTP](./assets/logo.png)

andOTP is a two-factor authentication App for Android 4.3+.

It implements Time-based One-time Passwords (TOTP) like specified in RFC 6238.  
Simply scan the QR code and login with the generated 6-digit code. 

This is a fork of the great OTP Authenticator app written by Bruno Bierbaumer,
which has sadly been inactive since 2015. All credit for the original version
goes to Bruno.

## Features:
- Free and Open-Source
- Requires minimal permissions
  - Only camera access for QR code scanning
- Encrypted storage
- Sleek minimalistic Material Design
- Great Usability 
- Compatible with Google Authenticator
